# Building a neural network from Scratch (Using only NumPy)

The purpose of this project is to gain a strong foundation on Neural Networks (NN) which are the building blocks of Artificial Intelligence. By coding Neural Networks from scratch, a better understanding of the intricacies of NN.

In order to understand Neural Networks, it can be breakdown into major areas:

 1. Initialization of layers
 2. Feedforward (Activation Function selection + Cache Variable Storage)
 3. Backpropogation (Computing equations of gradients)
 4. Gradient Descent 
 5. Optimization

The codes are commented thoroughly to aid understanding of the inner workings of Neural Network and how to implement it in codes for Python. Please do view `NN_Scratch.py` for more information.
